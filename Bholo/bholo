first get rid of odd numbers as much as we can.

example:

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16

(15,1) => removal of 14

(13,3) => removal of 10

(11,5) => removal of 6

(9,7) => removal of 2

what's left 4 8 12 16

and upon dividing by 4 it will be again 1 2 3 4

i think you can now see the obvious recursion

we need to make sure there are even count of odd numbers while performing the removal otherwise we will not get a good pattern like 4,8,12,16

If there is odd count of odd numbers remove the last odd number
